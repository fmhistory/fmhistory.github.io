longtitle: "Feature Description Language (FDL)"
description: "This is a foundational work that transitioned FMs from a largely informal graphical tool to a formally verifiable and manipulable artifact. Its primary contribution was the proposal of the Feature Description Language (FDL), a textual Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to formally capture the variability expressed in Feature Diagrams. The historical significance lies in the introduction of the Feature Diagram Algebra, a suite of formal algebraic rules that enabled automated manipulation and analysis of FMs for the first time. This work established a concrete, tool-supportable approach to FM analysis by defining rules for normalization, variability calculation, and constraint checking."

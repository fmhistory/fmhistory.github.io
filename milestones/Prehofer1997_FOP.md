longtitle: "Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP)"
description: "This milestone marks the introduction and formalization of Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP). This work first proposed the concept, defining features as fine-grained increments of functionality similar to (abstract) subclasses but focused on the core functionality, with feature interactions (method overwrites) being specified separately. The core idea was to enable an exponential number of product combinations from a base set of features and quadratic interaction resolutions, going beyond standard object-oriented composition mechanisms like inheritance."

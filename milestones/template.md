longtitle: "Monte Carlo Tree Search for Feature Model Analyses: a General Framework for Decision-Making"
description: "This work introduces the first general framework applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to the Automated Analysis of Feature Models (AAFM). It represents a significant shift from traditional deterministic approaches (like SAT or CSP solvers) toward simulation-based methods. By modeling feature model analysis as a sequential decision-making process, the framework allows for efficient exploration of colossal configuration spaces, providing a scalable alternative for problems such as finding defective configurations, reverse engineering, and performance optimization."

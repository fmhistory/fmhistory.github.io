title: "Staged Configuration"
longtitle: "Staged Configuration of Feature Models"
description: "Historically, this work and its journal extension unified and formalized many disparate extensions into the Cardinality-Based Feature Model (CBFM) notation, which integrated feature cardinalities, group cardinalities, attributes, and diagram references. More critically, the work introduced the novel concept of Staged Configuration, acknowledging that in realistic development processes, different groups and roles (e.g., system administrator vs. end-user) eliminate product variability at different times or stages of the product lifecycle. This particular contribution at SPLC 2004 proposed achieving staged configuration through stepwise specialization (transforming a feature model into a less variable feature model)."

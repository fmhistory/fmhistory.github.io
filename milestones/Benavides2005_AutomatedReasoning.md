title: "Automated Reasoning on FMs"
longtitle: "Automated Reasoning on Feature Models"
description: "A major historical milestone as the first proposal to successfully model and reason on both functional and extra-functional features (i.e., quality or non-functional features) within a single feature model. Its key importance lies in introducing Constraint Programming (CP) and Constraint Satisfaction Optimization Problems (CSOP) as the formal foundation for automated analysis, alongside Propositional Logic. This work extended traditional FMs to include measurable attributes and attribute-based constraints. Furthermore, it generalized the capabilities of automated reasoning by defining a suite of five core operations (counting, filtering, listing products, validation, and optimization) that were more advanced than previous limited attempts. This established the paradigm for product-line optimization based on quality attributes like cost or development time."

title: "TVL Survey"
longtitle: "Textual Variability Modeling Languages: An Overview and Considerations"
description: "This milestone provides a comprehensive survey of the fragmented landscape of textual variability languages (TVLs). By identifying and analyzing over 90 different languages used in research and industry, the authors highlighted a significant lack of standardization and interoperability. This work served as the empirical evidence needed to convince the community that 'yet another language' was not the solution, but rather a unified, common language was required to prevent further divergence in the field."

longtitle: "On Language Levels for Feature Modeling Notations"
description: "This milestone introduces the architectural concept of 'Language Levels' to manage the diversity of feature modeling notations. The authors proposed that a unified language should not be a monolithic entity but a tiered structure where different levels of expressiveness (e.g., basic Boolean constraints vs. complex attributes and types) can be supported by different tools. This conceptual breakthrough allowed for a modular language design where simple tools can remain simple while advanced tools can exchange highly complex models within the same syntax."

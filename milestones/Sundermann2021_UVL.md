longtitle: "Yet Another Textual Variability Language? A Community Effort Towards a Unified Language"
description: "This paper introduces the Universal Variability Language (UVL), a community-driven initiative born from the MODEVAR workshop to address the fragmentation of textual feature modeling languages. It proposes UVL as a human-readable pivot format designed to facilitate model exchange between diverse researchers and practitioners. The work evaluates community preferences to ensure the language serves as a unifying standard rather than just another competing notation."

### Historical Significance
Before UVL, the lack of a standardized textual language forced researchers to constantly translate models between tool-specific formats, creating significant overhead. This milestone represents the first major collaborative effort to consolidate these needs into a single open-source ecosystem.

### Key Contributions
* **Community-Driven Design**: Developed through the MODEVAR initiative involving dozens of researchers to ensure broad acceptance.
* **Pivot Format**: Established UVL's primary role as a language for exchanging models between different analysis tools.
* **Initial Tooling**: Introduced a parser library and integrated UVL into established tools like FeatureIDE and TRAVART.

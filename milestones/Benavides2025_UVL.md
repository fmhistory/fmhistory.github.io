longtitle: "UVL: Feature modelling with the Universal Variability Language"
description: "As the definitive journal reference, this paper formalizes the syntax and semantics of the Universal Variability Language (UVL). It details the language's core structure across three primary levels—Boolean, Arithmetic, and Type—while providing a robust mechanism for future extensions. The publication solidifies UVL's status as the community standard, documenting its broad adoption in both academic research and industrial applications."

### Historical Significance
This milestone represents the maturation of UVL from a community proposal to a formally defined and widely adopted standard. It provides the mathematical and structural rigor necessary for UVL to serve as a long-term foundation for the Software Product Line community.

### Key Contributions
* **Formal Syntax and Semantics**: Provides the definitive guide and meta-model for how UVL models must be interpreted.
* **Tiered Architecture**: Consolidates the language into three distinct levels (Boolean, Arithmetic, Type) to manage complexity and tool requirements.
* **Ecosystem Maturity**: Documents the full ecosystem of tools, including open-source parsers for Python and Java, and its integration into major SPL frameworks.

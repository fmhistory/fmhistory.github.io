longtitle: "The PLUSS approach"
description: "The PLUSS approach (Product Line Use case modeling for Systems and Software engineering) was developed to handle the complexities of software-intensive systems with extremely long lifespans (e.g., 30+ years in the defense industry). It refined the integration of feature models with use case-driven development. Historically, it builds on FeatuRSEB and the Rational Unified Process (RUP), but introduces a more rigorous method for tracing variability from high-level features down to UML use case realizations. It treats the feature model as the 'choice-master' that coordinates variation points across all other technical models."

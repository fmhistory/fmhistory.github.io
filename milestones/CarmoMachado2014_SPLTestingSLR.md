longtitle: "Software Product Line Testing: A Systematic Literature Review"
description: "This Systematic Literature Review is a foundational milestone in the quality assurance of SPLs. Its historical importance lies in being one of the first major reviews to specifically focus on testing strategies aimed at achieving economies of scope and scale in SPL testing. The review systematically identified and classified available research, providing a crucial synthesis for the community. It explicitly defined and contrasted key strategies such as selection-based testing (testing a subset of products, e.g., T-wise testing) and family-based testing (testing the product line assets directly), and assessed their potential for efficiency gains. This work formalized the landscape of SPL testing, setting the context for subsequent research on identifying and addressing persistent gaps."

title: "SPL Testing SLR"
longtitle: "Software Product Line Testing: A Systematic Literature Review"
description: "This Systematic Literature Review provides a crucial historical snapshot and comprehensive analysis of the entire field of SPL Testing. Its historical importance is that it synthesizes two decades of work (from 2003 to 2022), offering an up-to-date classification, assessment, and gap analysis for researchers and practitioners. The authors analyzed 118 studies to answer key questions, confirming the maturity of certain areas (e.g., T-wise testing and automated configuration selection) while highlighting significant deficiencies. Most notably, the review identifies a major gap in techniques for non-functional testing (e.g., performance, security) and regression testing in SPLs, guiding the next decade of research focus in quality assurance for product lines."

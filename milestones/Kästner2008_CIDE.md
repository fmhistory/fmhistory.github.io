description: "This work addressed the critical gap between Feature Models (specifying variability at an abstract level) and Feature Implementation (realizing variability in code). Historically, existing implementation approaches (like FOP, AOP, or C-preprocessor) primarily supported coarse-grained features (e.g., adding/wrapping entire classes or methods). This work showed that fine-grained extensions (e.g., adding a single statement or expression inside a method body) are essential, particularly when extracting features from legacy systems or for minimizing code replication. The key contribution was the introduction of Colored IDE (CIDE), a tool that allowed developers to implement both coarse and fine-grained extensions in a clean, concise, and separated manner by coloring code elements according to the feature they belong to. CIDE thus offered a fundamental implementation mechanism that directly supported the full variability complexity captured in Feature Models."

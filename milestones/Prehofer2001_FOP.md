longtitle: "Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP)"
description: "This work extended and formalized the Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP) model, specifically introducing explicit interaction handlers to adapt features and address the feature interaction problem systematically. Historically, this work is crucial as it connected feature models from the domain analysis phase (variability modeling) directly to the implementation phase (code composition), establishing one of the major paradigms, alongside Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), for realizing software product lines at the source code level."

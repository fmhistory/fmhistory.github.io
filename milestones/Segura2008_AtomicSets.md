title: "Atomic Sets"
longtitle: "Atomic Sets"
description: "S. Segura formalized and popularized the term Atomic Sets, proposing them as a generic technique for FM simplification. Its key contribution was to explicitly set the basis for the usage of Atomic Sets by defining specific algorithms and providing the first empirical evidence of their effectiveness in reducing the size of the propositional logic formula, thereby dramatically improving the performance of SAT-based analysis tools. The relationship between this contribution and its predecessor is that Zhang's work established the core idea (Equivalent Features), which Segura later formalized, named, and validated as a practical, scalable analysis technique (Atomic Sets)."

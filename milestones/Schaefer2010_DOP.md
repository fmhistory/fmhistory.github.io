description: "This work introduced Delta-Oriented Programming (DOP) as a novel, fundamental paradigm for implementing Software Product Lines (SPLs), offering an alternative to the compositional approach of Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP). Historically, FOP relied on extending existing code by stacking feature modules. DOP, by contrast, relies on a core module (a valid product) and a set of delta modules that specify additive, modificatory, and removal changes to the core code. This historical shift provides greater flexibility, as it supports modifications and removals that are cumbersome in purely compositional FOP approaches. Products are derived by applying a sequence of delta modules based on the feature configuration. DOP is particularly valuable for SPLs derived from legacy or existing single-application systems because it aligns closely with the patching/refactoring nature of such evolution."

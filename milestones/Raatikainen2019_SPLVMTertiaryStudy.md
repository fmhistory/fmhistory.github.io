longtitle: "Software product lines and variability modeling: A tertiary study"
description: "This Tertiary Study is a crucial historical reference for the SPL and FM community. A tertiary study analyzes and synthesizes the results of multiple systematic reviews and mapping studies. Its historical importance is that it summarized the state of research across the entire variability domain by synthesizing 86 existing reviews. The study characterized the landscape of existing systematic reviews, assessed their quality, and provided a multi-dimensional classification of variability models based on the development artifacts they cover (e.g., requirements, architecture, code). Crucially, this work confirmed the dominance of Feature Models across the lifecycle while identifying that research efforts were unevenly distributed, with a significant gap remaining in variability realization/implementation (i.e., the techniques for turning the models into actual code)."

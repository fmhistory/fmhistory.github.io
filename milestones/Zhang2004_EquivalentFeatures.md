longtitle: "Equivalent Features (Precursor to Atomic Sets)"
description: "This milestone focuses on the Atomic Set (AS) concept, a fundamental technique for simplifying Feature Models and improving the scalability of automated analysis. Zhang et al. first introduced the concept, implicitly recognizing that in any valid product configuration, certain features are always selected together or never selected at all. These sets of features that behave identically across all valid products were termed Equivalent Features and served as the foundational idea for Atomic Sets."

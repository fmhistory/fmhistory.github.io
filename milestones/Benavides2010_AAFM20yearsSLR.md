longtitle: "Automated analysis of feature models 20 years later"
description: "This is the first comprehensive literature review on the automated analysis of Feature Models (AAFM), covering research from the 20 years following their invention in 1990. Its historical importance lies in its role as a key reference point and conceptual foundation for the AAFM field. The authors synthesized previously disparate streams of work, defined a conceptual framework for the analysis process, and systematically classified 30 operations of analysis (e.g., void models, dead features, optimization) and four groups of automated techniques (i.e., Propositional Logic, Constraint Programming, Description Logic, and Other Analysis Techniques) used in the SPL community. The work also established several open challenges for future research, guiding the community for the next decade."

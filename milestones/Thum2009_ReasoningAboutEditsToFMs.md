longtitle: "Reasoning about Edits to Feature Models"
description: "This work addresses the critical and practical problem of Feature Model (FM) evolution. Since Software Product Lines (SPLs) and their models evolve continuously, designers need to understand and control how modifications to an FM affect the set of valid products (the product space). The historical importance of this work lies in providing the first formal and efficient framework for reasoning about and classifying FM edits. The authors defined a taxonomy of edits (refactorings, specializations, generalizations, and arbitrary edits) based on whether the edit preserves, reduces, or expands the product space. Most crucially, they presented an algorithm that automatically takes two FMs (before and after edit) as input and efficiently computes the classification and determines the set of added or deleted products, even for large models with thousands of features. This capability provided essential tool support for maintaining consistency and coherence during SPL evolution."

title: "T-wise Testing"
longtitle: "T-wise Test Case Generation"
description: "A foundational work in the testing and quality assurance of Software Product Lines (SPLs). Given the combinatorial explosion problem—where an SPL can have thousands or millions of valid products—exhaustive testing is infeasible. This work popularized the use of T-wise combinatorial testing as a practical and effective strategy for SPL validation. T-wise testing generates a small, representative subset of products that guarantees coverage of all possible interactions between T features. The historical importance of the paper lies in addressing the scalability and automation challenges of this method. It proposes and implements a toolset that uses the Alloy constraint solver to automatically generate T-wise test cases from Feature Models, and, critically, introduces strategies to split large T-wise combinations into solvable subsets to overcome the memory and time limitations of SAT solvers (\"all-at-once\" failure)."

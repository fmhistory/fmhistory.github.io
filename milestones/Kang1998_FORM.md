description: "FORM (Feature-Oriented Reuse Method) is the primary evolution and extension of the original FODA (1990) method. Its historical significance lies in bridging the gap between domain analysis (identifying features) and software architecture (implementing features). It introduced a systematic process for both 'Domain Engineering' (creating reusable assets) and 'Application Engineering' (building products from assets). Most notably, it introduced the four-layer feature modeling hierarchy—categorizing features into Capability, Operating Environment, Domain Technology, and Implementation Technique—providing a structured way to map high-level user requirements to low-level technical decisions."

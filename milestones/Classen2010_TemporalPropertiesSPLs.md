title: "Model Checking SPLs"
longtitle: "Efficient Verification of Temporal Properties in SPLs"
description: "A major historical advance in the formal verification of Software Product Lines (SPLs). Given that the number of products in an SPL can be exponential in the number of features (the \"combinatorial explosion\" problem), previous approaches to verify system behavior (e.g., model checking each product individually) were not scalable. This work's historical importance is that it introduced a scalable technique for verifying temporal properties (e.g., \"The system will eventually reach a safe state\") across the entire family of systems simultaneously. The key was to extend transition systems with features (Feature-Oriented Transition Systems) and apply a specialized lifted model checking algorithm. This allowed checking a single compact model, rather than 2N product-specific models, making the formal verification of system behavior in industrial-scale SPLs feasible for the first time."

description: "This seminal work integrates the feature modeling method of Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis (FODA) into the processes and workproducts of the Reuse-Driven Software Engineering Business (RSEB). Historically, it is significant for bridging the gap between requirements-oriented use cases and configuration-oriented feature models. It established the feature model as the central '+1' model that unifies different architectural views in domain engineering, serving as a 'catalog' and 'roadmap' for reusers to navigate and customize complex software product lines."

description: "This work introduced the concept of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and the first implementation in the AspectJ language. Its historical significance for Feature Models (FMs) is profound: it provided the second major technical solution (alongside Feature-Oriented Programming) for the realization of variability in Software Product Lines (SPLs) at the code level. The core concept is the crosscutting concern (an aspect), which is a design decision (like logging, synchronization, or security) whose implementation logically belongs to a single module but is physically scattered across many parts of the system's core functionality (the base code). AOP allowed developers to modularize these crosscutting features, thus directly supporting the implementation of features that require modifications to many different parts of a software product line. This capability was later integrated with FOP to create unified realization techniques."

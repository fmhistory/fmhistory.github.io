title: "Common Language Scenarios"
longtitle: "Usage Scenarios for a Common Feature Modeling Language"
description: "This work defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a unified feature modeling language by identifying ten critical usage scenarios. These scenarios range from model exchange between different analysis tools to the use of feature models in teaching and industrial certification. Historically, this paper transitioned the discussion from 'what a language looks like' to 'what a language must do,' ensuring that the subsequent development of UVL was driven by practical, real-world needs rather than theoretical aesthetics."

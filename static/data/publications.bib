  abstract = {Abstract Feature modeling is an important approach to capture the commonalities and variabilities in system families and product lines. Cardinality-based feature modeling integrates a number of existing extensions of the original feature-modeling notation from Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis. Staged configuration is a process that allows the incremental configuration of cardinality-based feature models. It can be achieved by performing a step-wise specialization of the feature model. In this article, we argue that cardinality-based feature models can be interpreted as a special class of context-free grammars. We make this precise by specifying a translation from a feature model into a context-free grammar. Consequently, we provide a semantic interpretation for cardinality-based feature models by assigning an appropriate semantics to the language recognized by the corresponding grammar. Finally, we give an account on how feature model specialization can be formalized as transformations on the grammar equivalent of feature models. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract Feature modeling is a key technique for capturing commonalities and variabilities in system families and product lines. In this article, we propose a cardinality-based notation for feature modeling, which integrates a number of existing extensions of previous approaches. We then introduce and motivate the novel concept of staged configuration. Staged configuration can be achieved by the stepwise specialization of feature models or by multilevel configuration, where the configuration choices available in each stage are defined by separate feature models. Staged configuration is important because, in a realistic development process, different groups and different people make product configuration choices in different stages. Finally, we also discuss how multilevel configuration avoids a breakdown between the different abstraction levels of individual features. This problem, sometimes referred to as 'analysis paralysis', easily occurs in feature modeling because features can denote entities at arbitrary levels of abstraction within a system family.

  abstract = {In product line engineering, systems are developed in families and differences between family members are expressed in terms of features. Formal modelling and verification is an important issue in this context as more and more critical systems are developed this way. Since the number of systems in a family can be exponential in the number of features, two major challenges are the scalable modelling and the efficient verification of system behaviour. Currently, the few attempts to address them fail to recognise the importance of features as a unit of difference, or do not offer means for automated verification.In this paper, we tackle those challenges at a fundamental level. We first extend transition systems with features in order to describe the combined behaviour of an entire system family. We then define and implement a model checking technique that allows to verify such transition systems against temporal properties. An empirical evaluation shows substantial gains over classical approaches.},

There exist analyses alternatives such as SAT solving or constraint programming. However, none of them have explored simulation-based methods. Monte Carlo-based decision making is a simulation-based method for dealing with colossal solution spaces using randomness. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that tackles various of those analyses using Monte Carlo methods, which have proven to succeed in vast search spaces (e.g., game theory). Our general framework is described formally, and its flexibility to cope with a diversity of analysis problems is discussed (e.g., finding defective configurations, feature model reverse engineering or getting optimal performance configurations). Additionally, we present a Python implementation of the framework that shows the feasibility of our proposal. With this contribution, we envision that different problems can be addressed using Monte Carlo simulations and that our framework can be used to advance the state of the art a step forward.},

  abstract     = {Highly configurable systems expose numerous variation points to be configured by the stakeholders. Deciding which variant to select for a given variation point is hard to know a priori because each variant affects the configuration properties (e.g., performance, efficiency, fault tolerance) differently, and evaluating all configurations is practically infeasible. This paper introduces an approach based on Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the influence ofeach feature selection when configuring a variability model. We split the whole configuration space into step-wise decisions driven by the variation points that a user normally needs to face/decide during the configuration process. Monte Carlo simulations approximate the influence of each feature variant evaluating as few configurations aspossible. Our solution complements existing sampling techniques to analyze colossal configuration spaces improving the understanding of the influence of each feature selection. It can be part of a decision-making tool to assist the user by means of recommendation systems and interactive configuration processes.}

  abstract     = {Challenging domains of the future such as Smart Cities, Cloud Computing, or Industry 4.0 expose highly variable systems with colossal configuration spaces. The automated analysis of those systems’ variability has often relied on SAT solving and constraint programming. However, many of the analyses have to deal with the uncertainty introduced by the fact that undertaking an exhaustive exploration of the whole configuration space is usually intractable. In addition, not all analyses need to deal with the configuration space of the feature models, but with different search spaces where analyses are performed over the structure of the feature models, the constraints, or the implementation artifacts, instead of configurations. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that tackles various of those analyses using Monte Carlo tree search methods, which have proven to succeed in vast search spaces (e.g., game theory, scheduling tasks, security, program synthesis, etc.). Our general framework is formally described, and its flexibility to cope with a diversity of analysis problems is discussed. We provide a Python implementation of the framework that shows the feasibility of our proposal, identifying up to 11 lessons learned, and open challenges about the usage of the Monte Carlo methods in the software product line context. With this contribution, we envision that different problems can be addressed using Monte Carlo simulations and that our framework can be used to advance the state-of-the-art one step forward.},

abstract = {Feature models are recognized as a de facto standard for variability modeling. Presented almost three decades ago, dozens of different variations and extensions to the original feature-modeling notation have been proposed, together with hundreds of variability management techniques building upon feature models. Unfortunately, despite several attempts to establish a unified language, there is still no emerging consensus on a feature-modeling language that is both intuitive and simple, but also expressive enough to cover a range of important usage scenarios. There is not even a documented and commonly agreed set of such scenarios.Following an initiative among product-line engineering researchers in September 2018, we present 14 usage scenarios together with examples and requirements detailing each scenario. The scenario descriptions are the result of a systematic process, where members of the initiative authored original descriptions, which received feedback via a survey, and which we then refined and extended based on the survey results, reviewers' comments, and our own expertise. We also report the relevance of supporting each usage scenario for the language, as perceived by the initiative's members, prioritizing each scenario. We present a roadmap to build and implement a first version of the envisaged common language.},

abstract = {Configuration is a key enabling technology for the engineering of systems and software as wells as physical goods. A selection of configuration options (aka. features) is often enough to automatically generate a product tailored to the needs of a customer. It is common that not all combinations of features are possible in a given domain. Feature modeling is the de-facto standard for specifying features and their valid combinations. However, a pivotal hurdle for practitioners, researchers, and teachers in applying feature modeling is that there are hundreds of tools and languages available. While there have been first attempts to define a standard feature modeling language, they still struggle with finding an appropriate level of expressiveness. If the expressiveness is too high, the language will not be adopted, as it is too much effort to support all language constructs. If the expressiveness is too low, the language will not be adopted, as many interesting domains cannot be modeled in such a language. Towards a standard feature modeling notation, we propose the use of language levels with different expressiveness each and discuss criteria to be used to define such language levels. We aim to raise the awareness on the expressiveness and eventually contribute to a standard feature modeling notation.},
